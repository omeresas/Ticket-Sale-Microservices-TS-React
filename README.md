## Microservices Apps in Typescript and React

The repository contains two apps I developed or am developing by using the Udemy course "microservices with Node.js and React" by Stephen Grider as a guide. However, I am **not following the same exact code** shown in the lectures, instead I am **changing API definitions and components where I see fit**. For example, instead of using the same database kind with different instances, I am changing one the databases **from MongoDB to PostgreSQL**, or using **RabbitMQ message broker instead of NATS**, to utilize the **smart endpoints, dumb pipes** motto of microservices.

### Mini Blogging App

The mini blogging app is a toy microservices app which demonstrates the very essential principles of microservices architecture. For documentation of this mini-app, refer to [notes I wrote during its development.](mini-blog-app/notes/README.md)

### Ticket Sale App

The ticket sale app is **in progress**, for documentation and development notes of this app, refer to [the folder of notes.](ticketing-app/notes/README.md)
